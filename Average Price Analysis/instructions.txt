Input the two csv files
Union the files together

Convert the Date field to a Quarter Number instead
	Name this field Quarter

Aggregate the data in the following ways:
        Median price per Quarter, Flow Card? and Class
        Minimum price per Quarter, Flow Card? and Class
        Maximum price per Quarter, Flow Card? and Class

Create three separate flows where you have only one of the aggregated measures in each. 
        One for the  minimum price
        One for the median price
        One for the maximum price
Now pivot the data to have a column per class for each quarter and whether the passenger had a flow card or not
Union these flows back together

Change the name of the following columns:
        Economy to First
        First Class to Economy
        Business Class to Premium
        Premium Economy to Business
Output the data
